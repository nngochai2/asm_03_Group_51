            <b><h3>1.  Designing a website and an application</h3></b>
                <p style="padding-left: 3cm; padding-right: 3cm;">Admittedly, the team members were all lack of experiences and the necessary knowledge to make a functional VPN application. Added to this, html was also an uncommon topic to us, since all we had learnt is how to make a table from html, which made us make several additional research. Consequently, making a fully completed website and an application was truly advanced and unrealistic to us. Hence, the website that we introduce just included the features of our future application and some additional information. This led to a problem is that what was worth to put on the website? The question followed us throughout the project because it is a common sense that describing an existed product is much easier that talking about a product that we have not produced, yet. However, owing to several meetings, the team could finally choose the appropriate content for our website.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 3cm; padding-right: 3cm;">Moreover, as mentioned above, due to lack of experiences, designing a website was a difficult task for us. We had to learnt by ourselves a lot to make sure that the website can work at first. Then, decorating the website was also necessary. We acknowledged that making it easy to read is not enough, and the main mission was to attract the usersâ€™ attention. To do so, we had to look at some websites that we found attractive and analyzed which made those websites so good-looking and what could we do to make it even better. As a result, we were able to be satisfied with the product that we had made.</p>
            <b><h3>2.  Time</h3></b>
                <p style="padding-left: 3cm; padding-right: 3cm;">Unfortunately, the project was held between the holiday season and the Lunar New Year, which means that we had to work during the holiday. In addition, the project required a report, reflections, a functional product and a presentation. It is undeniable that the amount of work was truly large. This very fact affected the project quite considerably, since most of us were not able to work with our 100 percent of effort. Hence, we have to work with more than 100 percent by the beginning of 2023. By doing so, we all agreed to work on two Assignments at the same time. While making html folders, we also made a report and added it to the presentation.</p>
            <b><h3>3.  Communication conflicts</h3></b>
                <p style="padding-left: 3cm; padding-right: 3cm;">In this project, there was one thing for certain that we had successfully overcome our shyness as well as our lack of communication since all of the team members had worked together for a quite long period of time. However, as mentioned above, the holiday season also made our communication become really difficult. This is the result of the amount of time each individual had to spend with their families and loved ones. Consequently, at the beginning of January, it was not easy to hold a meeting and even chatting sometimes was unavailable.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 3cm; padding-right: 3cm;">After that, the team communication was gradually better since the deadline was close. We held several meetings, both online and offline to come up with interesting ideas for our product as well as the presentation. All of those meetings were really effective because we all acknowledged that there was not any more time for us to waste.
                    </p>
            <b><h3>4.  Designing a VPN application</h3></b>
                <p style="padding-left: 3cm; padding-right: 3cm;">Although the process of making a VPN is usually a smooth one. There are many risks in making our own VPN. Some of the problems could be with obtaining a stable server, that we would redirect the data traffic through. This could be solved by outsourcing to a server hosting website.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 3cm; padding-right: 3cm;">Another problem that could occur is making sure that nothing could be traced back to us. This could be done by making the VPN delete the logs of users, which will make the VPN safer for everyone. Also, with more users it will be harder to trace back to the exact user.</p>
            <b><h3>5.  Presentation time conflicts</h3></b>
                <p style="padding-left: 3cm; padding-right: 3cm;">Our presentation for the product on January 11, will have some difficulties due to not all group members not having the same tutorial class times. This will result in us having extra difficulties in finding which time to present our project. This issue can be resolved by the group members discussing with each other and the lecturer on preferred time to present. This could also be done in a voting session, where we give our presentation at the time that the majority of the group agrees to.</p>
