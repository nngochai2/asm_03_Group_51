            <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
            <p style="padding-left: 3cm; padding-right: 3cm;">In nowadays fast-paced world, it can be clearly witnessed that there have been magnificent changes in the way people use the Internet. The users today can easily communicate with their friends and family, share their feelings on social media, book plane or train tickets and entertain themselves. However, owing to the comfortable use of the Internet, the door to unwanted intrusion has been gradually opened. While people are enjoying the convenient life and several opportunities that the Internet brings, the Internet itself is also providing the access to dangerous threats outside to users’ personal information as well as companies’ information.</p>

                    <p>Our group and project are named AREA 51. The name was made because we were the 51st group in our class and the numbers coincide. Also, Area 51 facility in the United States is famous for being secretive and protective about information, and our project is a VPN which secures and hides information. Hence, our team’s name, AREA 51.</p>

            <h3><b>Motivation</b></h3>
            <p style="padding: 3cm; padding-top: 0;">
                Personally, we believe that one of the main reasons why we do this project is based on our own experiences. We are still young, which means that the Internet has played an important role in our daily life. Thus, we can deeply understand the problems that every Internet user nowadays have. We know how it feels when people can not get the full answer while conducting research, we know how it feels when movie lovers could not watch their favorite movies and we know how it feels when there are several obstacles hindering us to have the best experience on the Internet. Consequently, we decided to use our own knowledge and experience remedy the current situation and improve the environment on the Internet. Then, we had a chance to meet each other, the people who shared the same interest and the same problems, leading to the formation of our group nowadays, AREA 51. It is our belief that those problems mentioned above will not magically disappear or will be solved immediately after a year or two, so we reckon that our product will still be necessary in the future, since everybody want to have a better Internet wherever they are.
