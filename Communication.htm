                            <p><b>Messenger:</b></p>
                             <p>This application provides the most convenient way to communicate with each other. Due to its simplicity, our members can chat and even make a call whenever we come up with new ideas or when we need to fix some problems. 
                            </p>

                            <p><b>Discord:</b></p>
                            <p>Even though Discord was introduced as an application for gamers to chat and call while playing games, the app provides a magnificent environment to cooperate. Normally, team members can exchange important information and pin it so that it will be much easier to find those messages when necessary.
                            </p>

                            <p><b>Google Docs:</b></p>
                            <p>Docs allows our team members to update our word document online. This is one of our most favorite applications since we can add and fix information as fast as possible and also know how long and how much each individual contributed to the project. 
                            </p>
                            </li>

                            <p><b>GitHub:</b></p>
                            <p>After being introduced with GitHub and GitHub Desktop, all of the team members all agreed that this is one of the most useful platforms to check the team progress as well as the members’ contribution, especially when it came to a project such as creating a website like this. By creating a Codespace on GitHub, each individual could write their code and commit it to the main branch, which was really convenient.
                            </p>
                            </li>
                    </ul>
                <h3><li>Offline communication</li></h3>
                    <p style="margin:3cm; margin-bottom: 1cm; margin-top: 0.5cm;">
                        Fortunately, all team members have shared almost the same offline timetable in two weekdays, so we have taken that chance and spent our time wisely. One every Thursday and Friday evening from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., the team agreed to gather at our school’s canteen to decide each member’s role, discuss the project and find the mistakes in our work. We have also asked our RMIT’s school service, Student Academic Success, known as SAS, which comprises several second or third-year students. By doing so, we can finally understand the requirements of the assignment as well as finish all the tasks on time. 
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin:3cm; margin-bottom: 1cm; margin-top: 0;">
                        Moreover, there was a presentation which was hold right before this assignment, so it was deeply important for us to hold several meetings on a regular basis to make sure the presentation went well. Luckily, RMIT University provided our team with some meeting rooms, which consists of a television with a suitable environment for us to practice presenting. By doing so, we could even find some errors in this project, because talking about it can give us a different view of the project that we were working on.
