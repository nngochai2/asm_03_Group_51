        <p style="padding-left: 3cm; padding-right: 3cm;">
            In general, our team has collaborated on two main platforms, GitHub and Google Docs which help us communicate with each other better, especially during the holiday season.
        </p>
        <p style="padding-left: 3cm; padding-right: 3cm;">
            To be specific, GitHub was a useful communication platform since it helped us to update our product as fast as possible. Moreover, the members’ contributions have been noted in detail, which lets us know who has the most contribution or who has not done anything at all. This wonderful feature can alter the individuals’ scores much more fairly.

        <p style="padding-left: 3cm; padding-right: 3cm;">
            Overall, all of the team members had made specific contributions to our project. However, there were some differences in the amount of work done on GitHub among the members. In detail, Nguyen Ngoc Hai, who had experience in HTML, had contributed the most with the several commits, while others took care of the website’s design with Hai’s guidance. Nevertheless, there had not been any conflict between the members since members with fewer contributions could have several different tasks, such as creating a prototype or making a group report.
